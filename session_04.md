In this session, we focus on introducing common concepts and techniques in __Digital Image Processing__. We also would like to discuss how you can apply these techniques to Machine Learning tasks.

## Digital Image Representation

Before we give intuitive examples of _digital images_ or simply _images_, we would like to formally define the concept of digital image and _digital image processing_. One accurate definition is from the book _Digital Image Processing (2nd Edition)_ by Rafael C. Gonzalez and Richard E. Woods.

An image may be defined as a two-dimensional function, $$f(x,y)$$, where $x$ and $y$ are _spatial_ (plane) coordinates, and the amplitude of $$f$$ at any pair of coordinates $$(x,y)$$ is called the _intensity_ or _gray level_ of the image at that point. When $$x$$, $$y$$, and the amplitude values of $$f$$ are all finite, discrete quantities, we call the image a _digital image_. The field of _digital image processing_ refers to processing digital images by means of
a digital computer.

__Remark__: Although this book was published over a decade ago, the book presents a comprehensive introduction that both beginners and experts can enjoy reading.
