# Setup your laptop for Scientific Computing with Python


## IDE

There are many different IDEs for Python on the market. Here, we list some of
them that generally deliver fantastic coding experience.

### Say NO to Jupyter Notebook

If you have taken a Python class or Python 101, you have probably seen that
instructors like Jupyter Notebook as a default presentation tool.
They even walk you though the steps so that you are comfortable with
this kind of coding style.

However, we are strongly against this paradigm of coding.
It is true that the Jupyter Notebook offered a nice presentation style.
But it is totally not designed for managing and engineering serious projects.

Therefore, we advice that you simply quit Jupyter Notebook.

### What do you generally need from an IDE?

+ Code auto-completion: let's just face it, no one is gonna remember hundreds or even thousands of commands.
+ Code navigation: if you want to check some definition or file, you need to get there fast.
+ Running the code: it should be easy to run the code.
+ Debugging: if there is anything wrong with the code, you should be able to find out which line is doing things wrongly.
+ Source code version control: Make sure your code is maintained and updated in a timely and efficient manner.
+ Static code checker: modern software engineering promotes the idea of producing high-quality _human readable_ code. Over the years, people has transformed specific coding styles into static code checker where the checker evaluates your code formatting and correct obvious errors.

### Atom

[Atom](https://atom.io/) is a very popular text editor that is built and maintained mainly by GitHub. This editor is modern and naturally integrates some of best software engineering practices. You can find tons of additional packages that helps you configure the editor to a Python IDE.

### PyCharm

[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is a new Python IDE that has a beautiful interface and integrates all the features you will need for developing a Python project.

### Eclipse+PyDev

If you are a [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) user, perhaps you would be very happy to know that there is a dedicate Eclipse plugin for Python. [PyDev](http://www.pydev.org/) takes advantages of the powerful Eclipse compiling and debugging framework.

### Vim

For experienced user, we recommend [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) or its community-driven fork [neovim](https://neovim.io/). By configuring Vim, you will be able to get a fast editor that has all the IDE features you want and being lightweight in some sense. Additionally, because Vim is a very flexible editor, you could do many things very efficient while other editors won't or can't do.
