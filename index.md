This module instructs students to learn the basics of deep learning as well as faster networks to build better and faster classifiers for sensor data. The module is strongly project-based, with two main phases. In the first phase, students want to learn the basics of deep learning and Computer Vision, such as stochastic gradient descent, multi-layer perceptron, convolutional neural networks, filtering, and corner detection. At the end of this first phase, students should be ready to run simple networks in Keras and also implement basic computer vision methods in Python. In the second half of their module, students divide up into teams of 2 or 3 to tackle a problem of their choosing, from fields like computer vision, pattern recognition, distributed computing. Example projects include face recognition, emotion recognition.
